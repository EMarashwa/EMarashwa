- 👋 Hi, I’m @EMarashwa
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, especially front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as backend technologies like Node.js and Express. I am also interested in databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and front-end frameworks like React.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a strong foundation in web development. I plan to explore Node.js, Express, and databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL for backend development, along with React for advanced front-end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly web development projects where I can contribute and learn.
